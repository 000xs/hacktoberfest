<h3>What's this?</h3>
<p>
    This is a blatant attempt to piggyback off the popularity of the global
    <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> event
    from Digital Ocean and GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    We are asking people to open 4 pull requests to <strong>Wichita
    based</strong> open source projects on GitHub during the month of
    October.
</p>

<h3>What do I get out of it?</h3>
<p>
    Some sweet stuff! A shirt, probably. Maybe some stickers too? We're still
    working that out.
</p>

<h3>What do you get out of it?</h3>
<p>
    A livelier developer community in Wichita!
</p>

<h3>What projects qualify?</h3>
<p>
    Any project from Wichita devs or organizations qualifies but it
    needs to be listed here.
</p>
<p>
    We will count PRs opened against any projects under any of these
    organizations:
    <ul>
        {{ range $org, $i := .Orgs }}
            <li><a href="https://github.com/{{ $org }}">{{ $org }}</a></li>
        {{ end }}
    </ul>
    Note that <a href="https://github.com/devict/hacktoberfest">the
        repo for this site</a> qualifies so maybe make this page look
    better? <em>(How meta!)</em>
</p>
<p>
    We will also count PRs opened against these individual projects.
    <ul>
        {{ range $p, $i := .Projects }}
            <li><a href="https://github.com/{{ $p }}">{{ $p }}</a></li>
        {{ end }}
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Would you like your organization or project to show up on these
    lists? Just let us know! <a href=">https://github.com/devict/hacktoberfest/issues/new">File an issue</a>
    against this site's repo or maybe make a pull request?
